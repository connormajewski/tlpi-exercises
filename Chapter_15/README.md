# 15: File Attributes
### **Exercise 15-4**
The *access()* system call checks permissions using the process's real user and group IDs. Write a corresponding function that performs the checks according to the process's effective user and group IDs.
### **Exercise 15-7**
Write a simple version of the *chattr(1)* command, which modifies the file i-node flags. See the *chattr(1)* man page for details of the *chattr* command-line interface. (You don't need to implement the *-R*, *-V*, and *-v* options).
